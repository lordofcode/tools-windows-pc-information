# tools-windows-pc-information
Windows Forms app to show information about your PC (memory, cpu, diskspace)

The output is in Dutch, but you will know what value it describes :)

Created it, because Microsoft stated to stop supporting Windows 10 and you had to move to Windows 11.

Currently (september 29nd 2025) Microsoft postphoned it to 2026, but it still handy to have this tool.

The minimal specs for Windows 11 are:

-  Processor which is 1 GHz or faster
-  2 or more cores
- a minimum of 4 GB RAM
- a harddrive with a minimum size of 64 GB
